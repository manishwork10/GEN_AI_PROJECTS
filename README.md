Gen_AI_Training_Projects
This repository showcases a collection of Generative AI (Gen AI) and other machine learning projects I have worked on. Each subfolder represents a distinct project, demonstrating various techniques and applications within the AI domain.

Project List
Here's a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

CGAN_Cat:Dog: A Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) project focused on generating images of cats and dogs based on specified conditions.

CNN_Image_classifier: An image classification project utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for various image recognition tasks.

Email_Spam_Classifier: A machine learning project designed to classify emails as either legitimate (ham) or spam.

Exploring_Embedding_Techniques: This project delves into different embedding techniques (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe, FastText) and their applications in various NLP tasks.

Implement_GAN_And_DCGAN: A foundational project demonstrating the implementation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) from scratch.

Inventory_Management_System: (Likely a non-AI project, but included in the training projects folder) This project appears to be an application for managing inventory.

RAG_database: Focuses on the database component for a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system, likely involving data storage and retrieval mechanisms for large language models.

RAG_System: Implements a complete Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system, showcasing how to combine retrieval mechanisms with generative models for improved output.

Testing_3_ollama_Model: This project involves testing and experimenting with three different models served through Ollama, likely exploring local LLM deployments and their performance.

Getting Started
To explore a specific project, navigate to its respective subfolder. Each project folder typically contains:

Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) for code and explanations.

Python scripts (.py) for core functionalities.

Trained models (if applicable).

Datasets (or instructions on how to download them).

A dedicated README.md file with more specific instructions and details for that particular project.

Prerequisites

Python 3.x

pip (Python package installer)

Installation

To set up the necessary environment for these projects, it's recommended to create a virtual environment:

Bash
python -m venv projenv
source projenv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# projenv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
Then, install the required libraries listed in requirements.txt:

Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: Some projects might have additional, specific dependencies not covered in the main requirements.txt. Refer to the individual project's README for such requirements.

Usage
Navigate into the desired project directory and follow the instructions provided in its README.md file or Jupyter Notebooks to run the code and understand the project's implementation.

Contributing
If you have suggestions for improvements or find issues, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
